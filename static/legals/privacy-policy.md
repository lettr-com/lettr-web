1.  **<span class="mark">HOW WE APPROACH THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL
    DATA</span>**

<span class="mark">Your privacy is a priority. We only request the
Personal Data that are necessary to provide the Services, and we process
them in line with GDPR standards.</span>

<span class="mark">If you entrust us with your data, we will handle it
in accordance with the applicable data protection laws that apply to
you. Our Processing of Personal Data may adapt to specific legal
requirements in the countries of processing; however, the GDPR is our
minimum standard in all cases. Your rights in relation to Personal Data
are described below.</span>

2.  **<span class="mark">OUR ROLE IN RELATION TO PERSONAL DATA</span>**

<span class="mark">Depending on the context, Lettr may act as a
Controller or a Processor.</span>

<span class="mark">**When does this Privacy Policy apply?** These
Privacy Policy terms apply when Lettr acts as a Controller, unless we
explicitly state otherwise. They cover the Processing of Personal Data
of Users. They do not govern situations where we process Personal Data
as a Processor on someone else’s instructions.</span>

1.  **<span class="mark">Lettr as Controller</span>**

<span class="mark">We act as a Controller in relation to Personal Data
that we collect and decide how to use, in particular:</span>

- <span class="mark">**Customers** using Service, support, data services
  (e.g., account data, billing contact, usage logs necessary for
  security and troubleshooting).</span>

- <span class="mark">**Website Visitors** to our public websites and
  pages (e.g., analytics, cookies - subject to consent where
  required).</span>

- <span class="mark">**Job Applicants** participating in our
  recruitment.</span>

<span class="mark">A list of categories of data, purposes and legal
bases is **provided below in this Policy**.</span>

<span class="mark">**Our Processors.** To deliver our Services
efficiently, we engage Processors (e.g., cloud hosting, email delivery,
analytics, support tools). We have data processing agreements in place
and require appropriate security and confidentiality. Our current
processors are</span> listed in Section 5.

2.  **<span class="mark">Lettr as Processor</span>**

<span class="mark">In the context of the Service (transactional emails),
we act as a Processor for the data you send through us.</span>

- <span class="mark">**Your Role:** You are the Controller. You
  determine the purpose (e.g., password reset, order confirmation) and
  the means (via API/SMTP) of processing data of your end-users
  (recipients).</span>

- <span class="mark">**Our Role:** We process this data (recipient email
  addresses, email bodies, metadata) solely on your behalf to deliver
  the email and track events (opens, clicks, bounces), in accordance
  with your instructions and our Data Processing Agreement (DPA).</span>

<span class="mark">Where we act as a Processor, we may engage
Subprocessors in accordance with the applicable DPA. Access to Personal
Data is limited and governed by contractual and technical
safeguards.</span>

3.  **<span class="mark">WHAT PERSONAL DATA DO WE PROCESS ABOUT
    YOU?</span>**

<span class="mark">**How do we process Personal Data?** We process your
Personal Data only to the extent necessary to achieve the purpose for
which the data was collected, and we observe technical and
organizational security rules during processing. The Personal Data
processing process is automated, but we do not conduct profiling.</span>

<span class="mark">**Special Categories of Personal Data.** We do not
process any Personal Data of a sensitive nature about you.</span>

<span class="mark">**Processing of Personal Data by AI.** In the context
of processing Personal Data, we also use artificial intelligence (AI) in
justified cases. However, we do not use it for automated decision-making
or profiling within the meaning of the GDPR (in particular Article 22).
All processing of Personal Data is subject to human decision-making, AI
itself does not make any decisions about you. We use artificial
intelligence primarily for the provision of HR Services, especially for
research and optimization, and we also use it for our internal
HR.</span>

<span class="mark">**Processing outside the EEA.** If data is
transferred from the EEA to other countries, we ensure a high standard
of Personal Data protection through standard contractual clauses
approved by the European Commission, or equivalent standard contractual
clauses for the United Kingdom, for transfers to countries that are not
subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission or your local
legislator</span>

6.  **<span class="mark">WHAT MEASURES HAVE WE TAKEN TO PROTECT YOUR
    PERSONAL DATA?</span>**

<span class="mark">Our Users can influence the scope of processing
within the provision of Services through their own settings through
Platform in the User account.</span>

**Technical measures.** Security is very important to us, and therefore
we continuously work to ensure your Personal Data is protected. When
choosing measures, we take into account the scope
<span class="mark"></span>of processing, the risk of processing, or the
state of our technology.

- we regularly back up data;

- we update our antivirus software systems;

- we encrypt data using SSL/TLS („secure sockets layer / transport layer
  security“) for all data transmissions;

- we use secure https protocol;

- our server data is encrypted;

- we develop our technology with privacy by design in mind;

- access passwords to information systems (where Personal Data will be
  processed) and access permissions are controlled at the individual
  level.

**Organizational measures**. We have adopted and are committed to the
following measures:

- our employees and our service providers are bound by confidentiality;

- our employees are properly trained and also receive further regular
  training on GDPR and are familiar with the rules of safe working on
  work equipment;

- in case of API key retention, we remove authorization data;

- access to all systems including the IT system is personalized and
  covered by secure passwords;

- Passwords in the operational environment are stored in a separate
  location (safe store), where logs are logged, so that we can control
  employee access to individual Users' Personal Data.

7.  **YOUR <span class="mark">RIGHTS</span>
    <span class="mark">AND</span> POSSIBILITY TO SUBMIT A REQUEST
    REGARDING PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION**

<span class="mark">You can exercise your rights at the e-mail

<span class="mark">**How quickly will we handle your request?** We will

be disproportionate to the risks or costs of providing it, it is
possible that we will not be able to comply with your request. To handle
your request as soon as possible, we may need to verify your identity.
In the case of a repeated request, the Controller will be entitled to
charge a reasonable fee for a copy of Personal Data.</span>

8.  **<span class="mark">INTERNATIONAL PROVISION OF SERVICES</span>**

<span class="mark">If we use Processors who are based abroad, we ensure
that we comply with the requirements of the relevant legislation. In
particular, where there are transfers of data from the EEA to other
countries, we ensure a high standard of protection for Personal Data
through **standard contractual clauses approved by the European
Commission**, or the equivalent standard contractual clause for the
United Kingdom (UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)), for
transfers to countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision by
the European Commission or your local legislator.</span>

<span class="mark">We follow the standards of the GDPR and the
protection of Personal Data is very important to us. We also provide our
Services outside of the EEA market, so your rights related to the
protection of Personal Data depend on the applicable legislation that
applies to you.</span>

**<span class="mark">CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT</span>**

<span class="mark">If you are a California resident or resident of other
states of the United States of America, you are subject to the CCPA
legislation and have the right to know how we process your data.</span>

<span class="mark">**What data do we process?** In order to provide our
Service to you, we need your data. What personal data this is and for
what purpose we process it is set out above. We may retain this personal
data for as long as needed for the purposes for which it was collected,
and only for the necessary period. This will depend on our business,
legal and regulatory needs, but it will always be for a reasonable
period of time.</span>

| **<span class="mark">What are your rights?</span>** | <span class="mark">The CCPA guarantees you the following rights.</span> |

We will delete your data unless we have a legal obligation to retain your data or one of the other exceptions applies.</span> |
| **<span class="mark">Right to refuse sale or sharing</span>** | <span class="mark">You have the right to refuse to allow us to sell your data. As we share personal data with our Processors, this operation may be considered a sale of personal data under the CCPA.</span> |
| **<span class="mark">Right to rectification</span>** | <span class="mark">You have the right to request the correction of inaccurate personal data. You can correct certain data in your user account.</span> |
| **<span class="mark">Right to restrict the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information</span>** | <span class="mark">You may request that we use your sensitive data (birth number, bank account information, etc.) only for the purpose of providing you with Services.</span> |

We may require verification of your identity in order to process your
request, depending on the nature of the right you are exercising. If a
representative is exercising rights on your behalf, we will need to see
proof of their authority to do so. We will also require your
representative to identify themselves. We take these steps to ensure the
highest possible standard of protection of your Personal Data.
