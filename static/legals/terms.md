6.  **REMUNERATION FOR THE SERVICE AND METHOD OF PAYMENT**

    1.  **Use of the Service for a Fee.** The Service is provided for a
        fee. You undertake to pay us the Fee for the provision of the
        Service, in accordance with the rules set out in the [<u>Price
        List</u>](https://lettr.com/#pricing) and these Terms. An
        exception to the obligation to pay the Fee is the use of the
        Service for free according to the following paragraph.

    2.  **Free use of the Service.** If you use our Service within the
        free Tariff Program, you do not have to pay anything until you
        exceed the Tariff band, which is designated as free in the Price
        List. If the free Tariff band is exceeded, you do not have to
        worry that you will immediately pay something extra. As soon as
        this Tariff band is exceeded, we will temporarily block your
        User Account and inform you about the Tariff band being exceeded
        either by email, through your User Account or by phone.

    3.  **Amount of payment of the Fee.** The amount payment of the Fee
        vary depending on which Tariff Program you use. The amount of
        the Fee is set out in the valid Price List published on our
        website:
        [<u>https://lettr.com/#pricing</u>](https://lettr.com/#pricing).

    4.  **Payment method**. The only accepted payment method is through
        electronic payment instruments. You are obliged to follow the
        instructions and conditions of the operator of the payment
        service when making the relevant payment.

    5.  **VAT.** Unless otherwise stated in the Price List , all prices
        contained therein are stated excluding VAT, which is charged at
        the statutory rate to the stated price. The amount of VAT
        charged may therefore change depending on changes in
        legislation.

    6.  **Price List Change.** We may unilaterally change the Price
        List. Information about planned changes to the Price List will
        always be available on our website. Planned change to the
        [<u>Price List</u>](https://lettr.com/#pricing) will be notified
        to the Users affected by such changes at least 15 days before
        they become effective, either by means of a notification in the
        User Account or by email. If you do not agree with the change to
        the Price List, you have the right to withdraw from the
        contractual relationship under these Terms.

    7.  **Payment of the Fee**. The User shall pay the Provider a
        lump-sum payment in the amount determined according to the
        Tariff Program selected by the User. The Fee is payable only
        monthly.

    8.  **Payment Due Date for Tariff Programs.** You are obliged to pay
        the fee for the provision of our Service in advance, for each
        Billing Period that has already begun (applies to all Tariff
        bands for Tariff Programs):

        1.  normal Billing Period starts every first day of a new month
            and lasts exactly one month;

        2.  in cases when the start of provision of the Service doesn’t
            fall on the first day of a month, the Billing period will be
            shortened and will end on the last day of the respective
            month. The Fee in these cases will be altered accordingly to
            the days left in this shortened Billing period and will be
            lowered proportionately to the number of remaining days of
            the month.

    9.  **Changes to Tariff Programs.** The User may change their Tariff
        Program in the middle of the Billing period but only to a higher
        Tariff Program. The User may not change their Tariff Program to
        a lower one (could be done as it is set in paragraph 6.10.). In
        these cases, the User will be surcharged the higher Fee of the
        Tariff Program and from that the already paid Fee for the
        Billing Period will be subtracted. Therefore the User will not
        pay more than the Fee set for the higher program for that
        particular Billing period.

    10. **Change to the future period.** The User is entitled to change
        the Tariff Program at any time to a lower or higher Tariff
        Program, with this change being effective from the next Billing
        Period, i.e. from the first day of the following month. There
        are no fees or rebilling associated with such a change, from the
        next Billing Period the User pays the price for the given Tariff
        Plan according to the Price List.

    11. **Exceeding the Tariff band.** In cases when the User exceeds
        their Tariff band according to their Tariff plan the User will
        be charged extra fees according to the [<u>Price
        List</u>](https://lettr.com/#pricing). This means that each
        Tariff program has its own designated Tariff band, which is
        included in it, and if it is exceeded, the Tariff program does
        not automatically increase (the User can do this himself
        according to paragraph 6.9.), but these fees are charged
        additionally.

    12. **Non-use of Tariff band in Tariff program.** If the User does
        not use any Emails from the prepaid Tariff program or uses only
        part of them, he/she is not entitled to a refund of any part of
        the Fee or an automatic reduction of the Tariff program, this is
        a prepaid number of Emails that is forfeited if not used.

    13. **Rate limiting.** Each Team is limited by how many e-mails a
        Team can send per said amount of time according to their set
        Tariff Program, by default, the number of Emails that can be
        sent in one hour or other specified time period is limited. Each
        Tariff program has its rate limiting set out in the [<u>Price
        list</u>](https://lettr.com/#pricing). It is not a malfunction
        of the Service if you want to send a larger number of Emails in
        a given time period, Lettr is not liable for any damage caused
        by the User needing to send more Emails in a given period than
        the Service limit.

    14. **Payment Details and Information.** When setting up a method of
        payment for the Fee, you are required to provide accurate, valid
        and complete billing and payment information. If any such
        information changes, you are required to update this information
        within your User Account.

    15. **The moment of payment of the Fee and provision of the
        Service.** The Fee is considered paid after the funds in the
        agreed amount are credited to our bank account. We are not
        obliged to start providing the Service before the moment of
        payment of the Remuneration in full.

    16. **Delay of the User and temporary limitation of the provision of
        the Service.** In the event of a delay in payment of the Fee, or
        any part thereof, i.e. in particular, but not exclusively, if
        for any reason the Fee is not automatically debited from your
        payment card for more than 5 days from the due date of the Fee,
        we are entitled to limit the provision of the Service to you
        according to these Terms and to resume it only after the payment
        of the outstanding Fee and, if applicable, the selection of a
        new or correction of the existing method of payment of the
        Reward.

        right to limit or suspend the provision of the Service if we
        believe that you are in breach of these Terms and/or legal
        regulations. Such a decision will be sent to you no later than
        the moment when the limitation or suspension of the Service
        takes effect, either through your User Account or to your email
        (usually 15 days in advance). We do not have to provide a
        justification for the suspension or limitation of the Service,
        in particular if we are able to prove that you have repeatedly
        violated these Terms and/or legal regulations, which led to the
        termination of the provision of the Service.

    2.  **Exceptions to Notice Obligation.** You acknowledge that we are
        not required to notify you of a decision to limit or suspend the
        Service at least fifteen (15) days in advance, provided that:

        1.  we are subject to a legal or regulatory obligation requiring
            us to cease providing the Services to a business User in a
            manner that does not allow us to meet the notice period;

        2.  we exercise the right to terminate the provision of the
            Services for an urgent reason in accordance with applicable
            law; or

        3.  we are able to prove that you have repeatedly violated these
            Terms and Conditions or legal regulations, which led to the
            termination of the provision of the Service.

    3.  **Termination of the Service.** We reserve the right to make the
        Service permanently unavailable at any time. In such a case, we
        are obliged to notify you of such decision, together with the
        justification, at least thirty (30) days before the termination
        decision takes effect. In such a case, we will send you the
        notification either through your User Account or to your E-mail.

13. **DURATION AND POSSIBILITIES OF TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACTUAL
    RELATIONSHIP**

    1.  **Duration of the contractual relationship.** This contractual
        relationship is concluded for an indefinite period of time,
        namely at the moment of your registration for the Service.

    2.  **Termination by the User.** You have the right to unilaterally
        terminate the contractual relationship under these Terms without
        giving any reason, by deactivating your User Account at your

        User Account via your email address specified in your User
        Account no later than the day of its deactivation. The
        contractual relationship under these Terms is deemed to have
        ended on the last day of the Billing Period in which the notice
        was delivered to the User or in which the User's User Account
        was deactivated.

    4.  **Fiction of termination of the contractual relationship.** The
        contractual relationship under these Terms is deemed to be

        Account, including your Database.

    5.  **Loss of ability to provide the Service.** You agree that in
        the event that we lose the ability to provide the Service
        through no fault of our own, i.e. for example due to a change in
        legal regulations, the contractual relationship under these
        Terms shall be deemed to have terminated at that moment, which
        shall not be considered a breach of these Terms.

    6.  **Material breach of the Terms or applicable legal
        regulations.** We have the right to limit or not provide the
        Service and block your User Account, including User content, and
        immediately withdraw from the contractual relationship under
        these Terms as soon as we discover a material breach of these

            regulations;

        6.  if you create a User Account that is offensive or otherwise

        7.  if the domain through which you send Emails is linked to a
            website that has not passed the check in accordance with
            point 7.1.;

        8.  if you act in violation of these Terms or applicable law;

        9.  if you use the Service in a way that may harm us and/or even
            attempt to misuse, block, modify or otherwise alter any part

            passwords of other Users of the Service;

        11. if you even attempt to use the Service or User Account to
            share or exchange data via Peer To Mail technology (e.g.

        12. if you even attempt to use a Database during the provision
            of the Service to which you do not have the legal title to
            process the Personal Data of Customers.

    7.  **Already paid Fee and material breach of the Terms.** In the
        event of termination of the contractual relationship under these
        Terms due to a material breach pursuant to the previous
        paragraph, you are not entitled to a refund of the proportionate
        part of the Fee already paid for the use of the Service.

14. **HOW TO PROCEED WHEN CHANGING THE PROVIDER (EU DATA ACT)?**

    1.  **Switching to another provider.** You may notify us at any time
        that you wish to switch to another provider of similar services,
        move your Exportable Data to your on-premises infrastructure, or
        delete it. In all cases, our obligation is to provide you with
        your Exportable Data, cooperate on your exit strategy, and
        provide relevant information. During the transition, we will
        ensure the security of your Exportable Data during its
        transmission, storage, and disclosure.

    2.  **Notice period and transition period.** After the notification
        under paragraph 14.1, a notice period shall run, which shall
        begin on the date of receipt of the notification and shall
        expire on the last day of the month following the month in which
        you have made the notification under paragraph 14.1, i.e. such
        period shall not be longer than two months. This shall be
        followed by a transition period of 30 calendar days, during
        which we will provide you with reasonable assistance with the
        migration. You have the right to extend the transition period
        once.

    3.  **Termination of the Agreement.** In the event of termination
        pursuant to this clause, the Agreement shall be deemed to have
        terminated: (i) on the date on which we confirm the successful
        completion of the migration/export of the Exportable Data,
        or (ii) upon the expiration of the Transition Period. We will
        notify you of such termination by email.

    4.  **Transfer of Exportable Data.** We will transfer Exportable
        Data to you in machine-readable formats or via APIs. A detailed
        and up-to-date list of categories, technical formats and
        available APIs is described in our online data registry
        available on the website. You will also find a detailed
        explanation there of how to switch to another provider, in which
        formats Exported Data can be transferred and what the transfer
        restrictions are.

    5.  **What data is not transferred.** We do not transfer any data or
        information that is ours. In particular, data regarding the
        Application, User Interface, other software, internal models and
        methodologies, and licensed data from third parties.

    6.  **Continuity of provision.** During the notice period, we
        provide the Services under the Agreement. After its expiration,
        we ensure continuity of provision of the Services also during
        the transitional period, to the extent necessary to complete the
        migration. This does not affect our rights to suspend or limit
        the Service in cases specified in these Terms (e.g., payment
        delay) and the rights to Necessary Maintenance.

    7.  **Data availability and deletion.** After the end of the
        transition period, we will retain and make available the
        Exportable Data for an additional 30 calendar days. After that
        period, we will perform a complete deletion of all Exportable
        Data and digital assets created directly by or directly related
        to the customer, if the transfer has been successfully
        completed.

    8.  **Fees.** If you terminate the Agreement by January 12, 2027, we
        will require you to: a fee for changing the provider in the
        amount of our costs for this change. You can find out their
        amount in the Price List. After 12. 1. 2027, these fees will no
        longer be charged.

    9.  **Discounts and early termination.** If you have received a
        discount on a Fee conditional on a longer period (e.g. an annual
        plan) and you terminate the contract early in accordance with
        this article, you are obliged to pay the difference between (i)
        the price after the discount for the period used, and (ii) the
        standard price without the discount for the period used. The
        amount will be calculated according to the Price List. This
        difference will be deducted from you when returning the
        overpayment according to paragraph 14.10.

    10. **Overpayment.** If the contract is terminated early in
        accordance with paragraph 14.1 and we record an overpayment of
        the Fee with you, we will refund this overpayment to you within
        7 days of the termination of the contract in accordance with
        paragraph 14.3.

    11. **Transparency of international access.** We store and process
        exportable data in the EU or EEA. We publish a current list of
        countries and involved subcontractors in our online data
        register. If there is a request for access to data from
        authorities outside the EEA, we will assess its legality and
        inform the customer of the provision, if legally permitted. We

        protection with appropriate technical and legal measures.
